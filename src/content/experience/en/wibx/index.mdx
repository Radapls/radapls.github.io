# My experience at Wibx Company

My experience at Wibx was a one hundred and eighty degree turn. It was the first company I joined after making my career transition. At Wibx, I learned a lot, not only about technology but also about relationships, living in a new country, learning a new language, and, of course, programming in this decade.

For me, Wibx was a space for co-creation. There was never a 'no' to trying something new. From Augmented Reality filters, to system design, to the administrative backoffice, application refactoring, and several, if not many, landing pages.

My experience as a frontend developer was based on understanding how Angular works as a framework and optimizing its development to work with TypeScript and SCSS as a CSS preprocessor. It was a great challenge, especially because I was not familiar with frameworks and had more experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge was of great scalability, even more so when coming from a completely different area.

However, I believe that being close to complex concepts such as reactive state, asynchrony, state management, and clean code for architecture made that path an enjoyable experience. I was always accompanied by teamwork, which I consider crucial at the beginning of a programmer's career. While inherent curiosity is great, having a group-guided approach will always be appreciated.

### Among my main responsibilities were:

- Creating new functionalities, as well as maintaining the base code for the backoffice (Business) and the application (Wibx App).
- Working together with the design team to efficiently deliver new functionalities to the core business.
- Managing HTTPS requests with RESTful APIs for the different integration modules.
- Modular refactoring of the business (WBSC).
- Creating landing pages in alignment with the marketing team for the launch of strategies and campaigns.
