# My Experience at BirdiRx

Birdi was a significant challenge in my career, not only because it was my first English-language project but also because it involved navigating a new and unfamiliar area: healthcare in the United States. From having no knowledge of the systems to understanding patient policies and HIPAA regulations, Birdi provided a space where I could grow both personally and professionally.

As contractors, we don't always have a complete picture of what our clients want, but Birdi was an excellent experience that showed me the value of embracing challenges. From PCM to the main site, it was a wonderful journey, supported by a highly collaborative team.

Working with GatsbyJS and Drupal for the first time was both rewarding and demanding, especially learning to code in PHP. I created my first custom module in Drupalâ€”perhaps a small achievement to some, but a meaningful milestone for me. Alongside this, I had the opportunity to contribute to several new features, including:

- Medicine Cabinet Redesign
- Family Account Release
- Membership Program
- [Discount Card](https://www.birdirx.com/discount-card)
- Payment History Redesign

Birdi was an invaluable experience, allowing me to gain knowledge and develop skills while collaborating across different cultures, time zones, and languages. Our team communicated in Spanish, Portuguese, and formal English, which enriched the experience further.

As part of the web team, my role was to understand the client's needs and translate them into impactful features. I take great pride in knowing that my work contributed to the thousands of users who rely on the platform daily

Of course, there were challenges, especially in prioritizing tasks amidst acquisitions and new high-priority requests emerging weekly. However, our work was organized and focused on delivering valuable improvements. We evolved from a small group of developers into a multidisciplinary team dedicated to identifying and solving problems more effectively.
