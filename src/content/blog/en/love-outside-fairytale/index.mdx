When I was young I used to remember myself as a loving person, the one that could reach anything with the love from my heart. In that time I used to think that the fairytales the drama-comedies from Hollywood was a good example of how the things work and how should I manage my relationship and not just with a girlfriend, but also with my family, my friends my coworkers.

Time pass and make me rethink about that tales, the once that said that all you need to do s doing it with love and the results should come, well in other words I think there’s some disclaimers for that phrase. Love don’t just only means care, it also means manage with a lot of other things that are not so grate, like anger, anxiety, lack of emotion and so on, that’s where the things start making some noise. Why if they tell me that everything with love will gonna be all right it’s falling now? Am I the problem?

Well, that's not an easy answer, but after sometime wondering I realize that:

1. Love also means thing that you do not gonna like
2. The love implies the resignation for a lot of things that you love (or used to)
3. There's no a single definition of it
4. It can be painful but also rewarding

As whatever in life we can see a lot of things, we can read about it, wonder and rethink that, but the experience is what at the end its gonna show you the answers (at least for you). So that’s the thing, what I have learned is that you have to love without an expectation of what it should be, and getting that answers back from the experiences. At the end, the love means nothing if you cannot get it back from someone that you love.

Life seems to be simple when we concentrate on the meaningful, so that's the thing, just love what you love and learn about it. What does it matter if we're all going to die someday?
