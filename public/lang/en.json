At Wibx, I learned a lot, not only about technology but also about relationships, living in a new country, learning a new language, and, of course, programming in this decade.",
        "content2": "For me, Wibx was a space for co-creation. There was never a 'no' to trying something new. From Augmented Reality filters, to system design, to the administrative backoffice, application refactoring, and several, if not many, landing pages.",
        "content3": "My experience as a frontend developer was based on understanding how Angular works as a framework and optimizing its development to work with TypeScript and SCSS as a CSS preprocessor. It was a great challenge, especially because I was not familiar with frameworks and had more experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge was of great scalability, even more so when coming from a completely different area.",
        "content4": "However, I believe that being close to complex concepts such as reactive state, asynchrony, state management, and clean code for architecture made that path an enjoyable experience. I was always accompanied by teamwork, which I consider crucial at the beginning of a programmer's career. While inherent curiosity is great, having a group-guided approach will always be appreciated.",
